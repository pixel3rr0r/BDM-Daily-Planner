This website was purely made out of boredom during some lectures (also, I keep forgetting to do my dailies/weeklies). It serves as a planner for daily and weekly tasks as well as for having an overview of the scheduled events and (non-alyaelli) world bosses.
Since this was a just-for-fun project made to refresh my JavaScript knowledge, it's not perfect and might or might not receive updates in the future.
